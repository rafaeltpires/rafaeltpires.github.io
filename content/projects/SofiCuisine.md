## SofiCuisine - The ultimate cooking recipes manager ( for me, of course )

I'm thrilled to share a small but exciting programming project that I'm embarking on.

This project is an exciting opportunity for me to apply my programming knowledge and develop a solution for me and my lovely girlfriend ( Sofi ) and our lack of organization in the kitchen and weekly groceries.

### Ã‰tat de l'art

The main ideia for the base project is to create a recipes manager with 5 simple features:

- Add, Remove and Update Recipes with bulk adding from different sources, as manual, scrapping books, websites and consume API's.
- Have dinamic properties to recipes, like, we can create different entities to classify our recipes.
- Schedule weekly our monthly meals. ( maybe integration with google calendar )
- Make a grocery list from weekly/monthly schedule. ( in several formats, maybe integrate with a notes application )
- Basic role and permissions system so we can controll all the aplication.

### Inital Stack ( can change )

 - Backend:
    - Laravel 10*
 - Frontend:
    - Nuxt 3*

### Let's begin

#### Entityâ€“relationship Model V1

As i said, i want to make the system the most dinamic possible for the final user ( Sofi and me ). For that i added a entities recipes table with a pivot table to work as a dynamic table.

I used the same ideia for the ingredients table.

The schedule *module* will be very simple, and probably i will have to change it if in future if i want to integrate with Google Calendar or something like that.

For permissions i will use the **spatie/laravel-permission***  because i don't want to reinvent the wheel and isn't my main focus on this project.

You will see that i don't have a place to record multimedia, because i'm still working on that, and choosing the service that i will use to store it.

For now, that's it, i will put the flows on *paper* and start my epic (so-so) journey.
