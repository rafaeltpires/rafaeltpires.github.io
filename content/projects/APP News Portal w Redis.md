## A Journey of Learning and Building

In 2022, i started my first Laravel project and followed a helpful Udemy course by Jorge Sant Ana. Using Laravel 8 I embarked on an exciting learning adventure.

I explored the capabilities of Laravel and learned how to integrate Redis. Laravel's user-friendly environment and clear code structure made it a great choice for my project.

It provided me with practical knowledge and a solid foundation to continue exploring the possibilities of Laravel development.
